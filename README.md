# TXR.go

A re-implementation of [YellowAfterLife's](https://yal.cc) [Tiny Expression Runtime](https://yal.cc/interpreters-guide/) written in Go

## Potential Future Work

- Identifiers are currently unimplemented. The Reference Implementation achieves this by exposing the underlying GM variable environment, so this would likely need to be implemented from scratch, which I may do at some point in the future
- Option to show/hide debug output
- Expand the implementation to cover [Part 2](https://yal.cc/interpreters-guide-2/)
